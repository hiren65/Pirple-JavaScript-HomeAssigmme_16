Homework Assignment #16: Rest and Spread


Details:
 

What are the differences between rest and spread? When would each be appropriate too use? In your own words, 
write 1 - 2 paragraphs explaining the different use-cases for each. If English is not your native language, 
feel free to write in whatever language you prefer. Just please note which language it is at the top of the assignment, 
so we know how to translate it.

Create a file called restAndSpread.js and add your explanation as comments at the top of the page.

Then, within the document write 2 code examples (1 for rest, 1 for spread) showcasing the use-cases you explained above.



Video Component:

Make a screencast showing off the code examples you wrote for this assignment. Walk us through your file(s), 
line by line, explaining what the code means and why you wrote it the way you did. If you're comfortable doing so, 
please narrate as you go and explain what you're showing us.
